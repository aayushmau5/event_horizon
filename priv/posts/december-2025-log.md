Happy New Year!

2025 was good-ish. It was a bittersweet ending to this year.

December highlights were: Potluck party/hangout with friends on Christmas eve and absolutely doing nothing on New Year's eve.

Apart from that, I finished reading "Blue Sisters"(on 31st). I planned a quite big book reading list that I would finish before the end of the year, but I was able to finish only one. Better than none I say.

On the technical side, I purchased [Elixir Patterns](https://elixirpatterns.dev) book. Been going through the book and learning new elixir patterns that I am not familiar with. I have only been halfway through the book, but still highly recommend for Elixir folks. A lot of new things to know.

Other than that, watched movies("Train Dreams" was a highlight). Played some games(currently playing Wolfenstein: The New Order).

That's it. Let's see what the next year brings!
