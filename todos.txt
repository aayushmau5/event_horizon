Things to do first:
- image generation for blogs(compile time). Should be fast enough!
    - aiming to do this with code
    - maybe compile and store before pushing it to git?

Cluster:
- connect with cluster(for real-time metrics)
    - have a cluster page?
- Footer live stuff
    - after clustering
- contact page
    - after clustering
- blog
    - like button
        - after clustering
    - comments
        - after clustering


- Move to MDEx v 0.11.1

- refactor code
    - right now, it's a mess of css & tailwind.
        - consider moving to tailwind

Future:
