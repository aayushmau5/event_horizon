Immediate:
- change @site_url in SEO to "aayushsahu.com" once we deploy this app to aayushsahu.com
- refactor code
    - right now, it's a mess of css & tailwind.
        - consider moving quite a lot of it to tailwind

Future:
- HTML view of the resume(with download button to download)

Not yet planned:
- Move to MDEx v0.11.1
    - Evaluate the changes. Nothing major to change. Skipping using the `to_heex!` function.
