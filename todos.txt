Things to do first:
- themeing ability
- SEO stuff
- image generation for blogs(compile time). Should be fast enough!
    - aiming to do this with code

Cluster:
- connect with cluster(for real-time metrics)
    - have a cluster page?
- Footer live stuff
    - after clustering
- contact page
    - after clustering
- blog
    - like button

    - comments
        - after clustering


- refactor code
    - right now, it's a mess of css & tailwind.
